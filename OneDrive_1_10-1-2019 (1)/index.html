 <p>These cat-like, carnivorous mammals comes from Madagascar. It is a member of the Eupleridae, a family of carnivorans closely related to the mongoose family. Its classification has been controversial because its physical traits resemble those of cats, yet other traits suggest a close relationship with viverrids.</p> </div>

     <p>The species is widespread, although population densities are usually low. It is found solely in forested habitat, and actively hunts both by day and night. Over 50% of its diet consists of rodents, lizards, birds, and other animals are also documented as prey. Mating usually occurs in trees on horizontal limbs and can last for several hours. Litters range from one to six pups, which are born blind and toothless. Infants wean after 4.5 months and are independent after a year. Sexual maturity occurs around three to four years of age, and life expectancy in captivity is 20 years </p>

     <p>The fossa appears as a diminutive form of a large felid, such as a cougar, but with a slender body and muscular limbs, and a tail nearly as long as the rest of the body. It has a mongoose-like head, relatively longer than that of a cat, although with a muzzle that is broad and short, and with large but rounded ears. It has medium brown eyes set relatively wide apart with pupils that contract to slits.

            <p>The fossa has the most widespread geographical range of the Malagasy carnivores, and is generally found in low numbers throughout the island in remaining tracts of forest, preferring pristine undisturbed forest habitat. It is also encountered in some degraded forests, but in lower numbers. Although the fossa is found in all known forest habitats throughout Madagascar, including the western, dry deciduous forests, the eastern rainforests, and the southern spiny forests, it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry forests.

                    <p>     The fossa is active during both the day and the night; activity peaks may occur early in the morning, late in the afternoon, and late in the night.The animal generally does not reuse sleeping sites, but females with young do return to the same den.Fossas communicate using sounds, scents, and visual signals. Vocalizations include purring, a threatening call,and a call of fear, consisting of "repeated loud, coarse inhalations and gasps of breath"  A long, high yelp may function to 
                    attract other fossas.</p>
         
         <p>        Females mew during mating and males produce a sigh when they have found a female.Throughout the year, animals produce long-lasting scent marks on rocks, trees, and the ground using glands in the anal region and on the chest.They also communicate using face and body expression, but the significance of these signals is uncertain. The animal is aggressive only during mating, and males in particular fight boldly. After a short fight, the loser flees and is followed by the winner for a short distance. In captivity, fossas are usually not aggressive and sometimes even allow themselves to be stroked by a zookeeper, but adult males in particular may try to bite. </p>

<p>Although the species is widely distributed, it is locally rare in all regions, making fossas particularly vulnerable to extinction. For its size, the fossa has a lower than predicted population density, which is further threatened by Madagascar's rapidly disappearing forests and dwindling populations of lemurs, which make up a high proportion of its diet. </p> </div>
     
<div class="three_col"> <p>The loss of the fossa, either locally or completely, could significantly impact ecosystem dynamics, possibly leading to over-grazing by some of its prey species.Taboo, known in Madagascar as fady, offers protection for the fossa and other carnivores.In the Marolambo District, the fossa has traditionally been hated and feared as a dangerous animal.</p> </div>
     
 <div class="three_col"> <p>It has been described as "greedy and aggressive", known for taking fowl and piglets, and believed to "take little children who walk alone into the forest". Some do not eat it for fear that it will transfer its undesirable qualities to anyone who consumes it.
